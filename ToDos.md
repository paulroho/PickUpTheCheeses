TODOs:
- Additional graphics
	- Animated raptor above the house
	- Better background
	- Variations in the flower clones
- Raptor can eat the mouse
- Random cheese position
- Prevent the mouse from going through the right wall
- Improved animations (breathing of the mouse, animated feet, moving flowers, ...)
- Make it work offline (manifest)
- Use css animations instead of movement controlled via javascript for each step
- Control area: position the controls without using absolute positioning
- Get rid of the horizontal scrollbar in the browser window (depends on mouse position!)
- Add some "Fork me on GitHub" banner


DONE
- Additional graphics
	- House left
	- House right
	- Markers denoting the step width (pieces of cheese, bread crumbs ->  flowers!)
- Prevnet restarting during a running animation
- Show messages within the page (div) instead of an alert box (kind of speech bubble)
